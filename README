Creates a pokemon game, the player can choose from 3 starter pokemon. NPC's can have 1-6 pokemon. Pokemon can also be randomly encountered in tall grass (':') and NPCs can be battled. Pokemon strength increases the further the player is from the spawn scene. The player has a bag of items (B), pokeballs can only be used in encounters. The chance of capturing a wild pokemon is a flat 60% for up to 6 pokemon. The chance to flee (only encounters) is a flat 40%. Currently no leveling up, status effects, or economy mechanics. The battle screen will occasionally not close after the battle is over, this is a visual bug only and pressing any movement key will move the character and set the screen as it should be.
